    "What design standards should I follow to ensure consistency across APIs?": """
Creating consistent and user-friendly APIs requires following established design standards and best practices. Here's a comprehensive guide:

1. RESTful Design Principles
Follow these core principles to ensure your APIs are intuitive and easy to use:

Resource Naming:
• Use clear, descriptive nouns for resources (e.g., /users, /orders)
• Keep URLs clean and readable (e.g., /users/123/orders instead of /getOrdersForUser/123)
• Use plural forms for collections (e.g., /products instead of /product)
• Follow consistent casing (kebab-case for URLs, camelCase for parameters)
• Maintain logical hierarchy in resource relationships

Example of good resource naming:
✓ GET /users/123/orders         - Get orders for user 123
✓ POST /products               - Create a new product
✓ PUT /orders/456/status       - Update order status
✗ GET /getOrdersForUser/123    - Avoid verbs in URLs
✗ POST /createNewProduct       - Avoid verbs in URLs

For resource naming guidelines, see <a href='https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/api-governance-model/pages/3-api-design' target='_blank'>GovTech's Resource Naming Standards</a>.

HTTP Methods:
• GET: Use for retrieving resources without side effects
  Example: GET /articles/123 - Retrieve article details
• POST: Use for creating new resources or complex operations
  Example: POST /orders - Create a new order
• PUT: Use for complete resource updates (idempotent operations)
  Example: PUT /users/123 - Update all user fields
• PATCH: Use for partial resource updates
  Example: PATCH /products/456 - Update specific fields
• DELETE: Use for removing resources
  Example: DELETE /comments/789 - Remove a comment

For HTTP method guidelines, check <a href='https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/api-governance-model/pages/3-api-design' target='_blank'>GovTech's HTTP Methods Standards</a>.

2. Request/Response Design
Maintain consistency in how you handle data:

Request Structure:
• Use descriptive parameter names that clearly indicate their purpose
  Example: ?status=active vs ?s=a
• Keep request bodies focused and well-structured
• Implement consistent validation rules across similar endpoints
• Clearly document required vs optional fields
• Use consistent data types for similar fields

For request design guidelines, refer to <a href='https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/api-governance-model/pages/3-api-design' target='_blank'>GovTech's Request Design Standards</a>.

Example Request:
{
  "orderDetails": {
    "productId": "123",
    "quantity": 5,
    "shippingAddress": {
      "street": "123 Main St",
      "city": "Springfield",
      "zipCode": "12345"
    }
  }
}

Response Structure:
• Return consistent JSON structures across all endpoints
• Include appropriate HTTP status codes with clear meanings
• Provide clear, actionable error messages
• Implement standard pagination formats
• Include relevant metadata

For response structure guidelines, see <a href='https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/api-governance-model/pages/3-api-design' target='_blank'>GovTech's Response Design Standards</a>.

Creating User-Friendly APIs

1. Design Principles

Core Principles:
• Simplicity first: Keep the API as simple as possible. Avoid adding unnecessary features or complexity. A simple API is easier to learn, use, and maintain. This reduces the cognitive load on developers and makes it easier for them to integrate with the API.
• Consistency throughout: Use consistent naming conventions, data formats, and error handling. This makes the API easier to learn and use, as users can apply their knowledge across different parts of the API. Consistency reduces the learning curve and makes the API more predictable.
• Intuitive behavior: Design the API to behave in a way that is intuitive and predictable. This makes it easier for users to understand how the API works and what to expect. Intuitive behavior reduces the need for extensive documentation and makes the API more enjoyable to use.
• Clear purpose: Each API endpoint should have a clear and well-defined purpose. This makes it easier for users to find the endpoints they need and understand what they do. A clear purpose makes the API more discoverable and easier to integrate with.
• Progressive complexity: Start with simple endpoints and gradually introduce more complex features. This allows users to learn the API at their own pace and avoid being overwhelmed. Progressive complexity makes the API more accessible to developers of all skill levels.

User Focus:
• Developer experience: Focus on creating a positive developer experience. This includes providing clear documentation, helpful error messages, and easy-to-use tools. A positive developer experience is essential for attracting and retaining users. A well-designed developer experience can significantly increase API adoption.
• Easy onboarding: Make it easy for new users to get started with the API. This includes providing clear instructions, sample code, and a sandbox environment. Easy onboarding is essential for attracting new users and reducing the time it takes for them to become productive.
• Quick wins: Provide users with opportunities to achieve quick wins. This helps them stay motivated and engaged. Quick wins can be achieved by providing simple endpoints that solve common problems and demonstrate the value of the API.
